Project: Linear Regression on Salary Prediction
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict Salary based on Years of Experience. The key steps involved are as follows:

Steps:
Import Libraries: Utilizes essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.
Load Dataset: Loads the dataset from a specified CSV file path with error handling to ensure the file exists.
Data Exploration: Displays basic dataset summaries (head, info, and descriptive statistics) to understand its structure.
Feature Selection: Selects the relevant columns, i.e., YearsExperience as the independent variable and Salary as the dependent variable.
Data Splitting: Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split for model validation.
Model Training: Trains a Linear Regression model on the training dataset using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
Visualization: Generates a scatter plot of actual data points and overlays the regression line for intuitive visualization.
Outputs:
Evaluation metrics: MSE and R².
A visual plot of the regression line showing the relationship between Years of Experience and Salary.
